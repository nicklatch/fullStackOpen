# Fullstack Open

## The good, the bad, and the ugly!

> It's all here.

This repo contains a well documented path of my journey into full stack development. These exercises were completed according to the instructions and tests provided during the course work. Please dig around and feel free to create an issue/pr to provide suggestions on how I can improve! 

Please note some exercised do not always use the most idomatic approach. This is on purpose and part of how the course progresses.

Thanks for looking!
